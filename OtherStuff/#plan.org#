* Introduction
** Assignment - get ruby script running with rugged, do simple dot assignment (maybe create a cycle of arbitrary size)
** Reading
* Internals 1: Trees and Blobs
** Assignment - make diagrams of trees and branches
* Internals 2: Commits and refs

** Assignment - augment diagram with commits and branches
** Alternative - invest history - take a bunch of trees
and make a commit history of them.
* Maybe something with recovering history
Undangle all - find all dangling commits and make refs for them

* staging/index/working directory
** Assignment - step by step lab scenario - maybe pushing a change to multiple branches
Perhaps followed by a quiz?
Using reset, checkout, stash
Maybe also fetch
** Assigment: maybe something that automatically saves on a WIP branch
i.e. you develop on a normal branch, but this sucker periodically switches your universe to a 
special WIP branch, adds a commit, then switches you back to your old universe
** backup one step
  branch - one prev
  -- commited -> staged
  -- staged - untstaged
  unstaged - stashed
  
* Merging
** Assignment - computing commits ahead/behind
** Other ideas
 or just draw the merge tree
 determine two branches' common ancestor - or commits ahead/behind
** Cherry picking?
* Rebasing
** Assignment - render rebase - commits with common commits having lines between them
* Rewriting history, squashing

* Reflog
** Assignment, adding dead branches to the diagram
* Strategies for branching and merging
* Git blame, bisect
