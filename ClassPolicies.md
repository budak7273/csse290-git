# Learning Through Doing (and Coding)

The overriding theory of this course is that you learn a complex tool like git through interacting with it. The assignments are where you will learn the most.

This means the course will have required code homework. It should take you 1-3 hours a week to do. Your homework grade will basically be the entirety of your course grade.

Because the assignments form the majority of the course, auditing this course will not be allowed.

# Late Policy

All homeworks are due at 11:55PM on the MONDAY before class.

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This course has no 'late day' policy and late assignments are generally worth 0 points unless you have made special arrangements.

However occasionally unforseen situations can arise. I handle all situations on a case-by-case basis. Here are some general guidelines:

-   I expect to be notified as soon as is feasible. If you are very ill, I understand that that might be slightly after the assignment due date. For other situations, it's usually possible to notify me in advance.
-   The usual extension I will provide is 24 hours. Occasionally I may allow 48 hours. More than that is very unlikely.
-   I keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be overusing the privilege we will stop allowing extensions.
-   If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble completing the assignment (e.g. a bug you can't fix or just difficulty understanding) get help from me! Don't assume that more time will fix the problem; plan to get help.



# Collaborating and Cheating

All assignments in this course are individual. Feel free to discuss the general idea of the assignments with your classmates, or use them as resources when you get stuck. BUT do not give or receive code from other students.

Cheating on even a single assignment is grounds for failure in the course, plus a letter in your file.
